ArcheAge (kor. 아키에이지 — "Ancient times"; ch. 上古世紀) — client fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for the PC, developed by Korean company XLGames. The game is set in the universe of ArcheAge — fantasy world with elements of medieval magic and steampunk.

Our project mainly focuses on version 1.01406. Later we will come back to version 3.0.

Before starting make sure to check AAServer\ArcheAge\bin\Debug\AAGameServer.exe.config, AAServer\ArcheAgeLogin\bin\Debug\AALoginServer.exe.config and AAServer\ArcheAgeStream\bin\Debug\AAStreamServer.exe.config for database password and also you can disable SSL from AAGameServer.exe.config and AALoginServer.exe.config by changing variable True to False".
